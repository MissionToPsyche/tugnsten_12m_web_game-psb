        <ui:Label tabindex="-1" text="Orbit A, the first orbit, is expected to last about 56 days, from August to October 2029, at about 441 miles (709 kilometers) above the surface. The mission will focus on imaging and mapping the asteroid while taking magnetic field and gravity measurements.&#10;&#10;During Orbit B, the mission will focus on mapping the topography and geology of at least 80% of the asteroid while also continuing to assess the asteroid’s magnetic field and gravity. Because sunlight will illuminate less and less of the asteroid’s surface when the first part of Orbit B begins, this orbit is split into two parts, B1 and B2, so that the spacecraft can complete its mapping requirement. Orbit B1 will last about 92 days, starting in late October 2029, and lasting until late January 2030. The spacecraft will return to the same altitude for B2 in May 2031, when sunlight returns to illuminating about 80% of the asteroid’s surface. The spacecraft will move into Orbit B2, traveling around Psyche at an altitude of 188 miles (303 kilometers) for about 100 days.&#10;&#10;Orbit D, the lowest in altitude, brings the spacecraft within 47 miles (75 kilometers) of the asteroid’s surface. At the same time, Orbit D marks a shift from a course that generally goes around the asteroid’s poles to one that generally travels around its equator. This orbit will help the mission focus on measuring the asteroid’s composition. The spacecraft will also map the asteroid and study its gravity and magnetic field. With about a month built in as a buffer, Orbit D is expected to start in May 2030 and last about 100 days.&#10;&#10;Transferring into Orbit C in mid-January 2031 (based on current expectations), at an altitude of 118 miles (190 kilometers), the spacecraft will shift back to an orientation around the asteroid similar to Orbits A and B. This orbit will measure topography and perform the highest-priority magnetic field and gravity measurements of the prime mission." parse-escape-sequences="true" display-tooltip-when-elided="true" name="text-content" class="info-text-content" />
